# Principles

Some basic principals apply to all programming, regardless of language.

## DRY (Don't repeat yourself)

Do something once. Grin and bear it when you do it again. If you do it three times, find an abstraction.

Use loops, functions, classes, etc to avoid repetition.

* [DRY - Wikipedia][drywiki]

## KISS (Keep it simple, stupid)

Avoid complexity. Simpler methods, classes, etc make code easier to understand, abstract, and modify. Make things as simple as they need to be.

* [KISS - Wikipedia][kisswiki]

## Open/Closed Principle

Things should be extendable, but not directly modifiable. Create abstracted things with interfaces that can be modified later.

* [Open Closed Principal - Wikipedia][ocpwiki]

## Single Responsibility Principle

Each thing, be it a class or a method, should do one task and do it well.

* [Single Responsibility Principle - Wikipedia][srpwiki]

## Loose Coupling

Minimize the number of dependencies and assumptions for each module.
