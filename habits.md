## Experiment

* Foster a healthy array of side projects
* Dabble in languages and frameworks outside of your usual area
* Try a wacky and bold solution

## Don't get attached

* Don't commit commented out code
* Murder your darlings. Be willing to throw away large amounts of your old code to adopt someone else's more solid solution.
* Don't get fixated on a design pattern that worked successfully once
* Sometimes an off the shelf solution will satisfy your desire to build better than building it yourself
* Maintain someone else's work
