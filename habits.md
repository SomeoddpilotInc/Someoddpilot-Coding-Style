## Experiment

* Foster a healthy array of side projects
* Dabble in languages and frameworks outside of your usual area
* Try a wacky and bold solution

## Don't get attached

* Don't commit commented out code
* Murder your darlings. Be willing to throw away large amounts of your old code to adopt someone else's more solid solution.
* Don't get fixated on a design pattern that worked successfully once
* Sometimes an off the shelf solution will satisfy your desire to build better than building it yourself
* Maintain someone else's work

## Fix what isn't broken

* Don’t take requirements for a project for granted. Investigate why each aspect is called for and how they relate.
* Use abstraction layers, but don’t lay on too much
* Find ways to reduce the size of the codebase without adding new functionality
* Look to existing functionality to see what can be extended or repurposed before adding

## Think in code

* Code blind

## Live by your language

* Avoid cross-platform solutions
* Sometimes maintaining functionality in two separate codebases *is* sipmler

## Be excited by failure

* Research historic failures to understand their causes and effects
* Take on a small but impossible project
