# Someoddpilot HTML Style

Wordpress has some [good general outlines for HTML style](http://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/coding-standards/html/).

## HTML 5

HTML code should follow HTML 5 standards for all elements.

* HTML 5 Doctype `<!DOCTYPE html>`

## Attributes

In order to preserve a short line length, elements with many attributes can be split across lines.

```
<a class="really-long-class-name-that-you-probably-shouldnt-have-used"
  href="http://www.somewhere.com">
```
