# Front End

A good starting point for front end development is our [SOP Front End Base](https://github.com/alexsomeoddpilot/sop-front-end-base). It provdies some basic setup for file structure, common tasks, Stylus, and a basic node.js server.

## Wireframe

The first step in building out a site is to create the basic page structure via HTML. It is recommended to start using the [Bootstrap framework](http://getbootstrap.com) at this point to provide basic scaffolding for the appearance and layout of the pages. Consider how things will appear, disappear, and shift when responding to browser sizes.

## Style

Start styling the website. Use good, modular styles to apply style to elements. We use [Stylus](http://learnboost.github.io/stylus/) due to its Javascript roots.

## Interactivity

We use [Angular](https://angularjs.org/) as the driver for interactivity. Angular allows for highly modular, reusable, and testable components with little fuss.
