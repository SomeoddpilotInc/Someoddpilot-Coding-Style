# Someoddpilot Javascript Style

All Javascript code should follow the general style outlines.

## Linter

[JSHint](http://www.jshint.com/) is arguably the best linter for the language as it additionally measures important things like cyclomatic complexity, number of statements, ect. A list of defaults should be set (globally and for each project). Global variables should be outlined either in the project defaults or on a file by file basis.
