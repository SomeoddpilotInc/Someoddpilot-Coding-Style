Getting Started
===============

Get to know the Terminal
------------------------

The terminal is your friend! OS X comes with the Terminal application (which you can find under `Applications > Utilities`), but I personally find [iTerm 2](http://iterm2.com/) much more robust and customizable.

The method of text input on the command line and the accompanying feeling of overwhelming power can be hard to work with at first, but try to push yourself to do more and more from the command line. You should quickly find it to be flexible and significantly faster than clicking through GUIs.

Install Homebrew
----------------

[Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) is a package manager for command line utilities for OS X. It manages dependencies and versions quiet articulately. When installing a command line utility, always opt for using Homebrew.

TL;DR

`ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"`

Install git
-----------

[git](http://git-scm.com/) is a free and open source, distributed version control system. It works incredibly well for managing project progress and tracking file history.

If youâ€™re following along at home, you should already have Homebrew installed, so all you'll need to do to install git is run:

`brew install git`
