# Back End

## Data

Consider the data that will be needed for the site. Divide that data into logical modules. In the case of Wordpress, these modules will be post-types. In the case of Sails, they will be models.

Consider what type of data each piece of data is. Is it a string? Is it an integer? Is it more complex?

Consider what pieces of data are required and which are optional. Are there required formats?

Consider which pieces of data are linked. Is the link one to one? One to many? Many to many?

Diagram this data and its relations.

## Models

Create models which define how the data is stored and retrieved.

## Controllers

Create controllers which call for data, modify it, and then deliver it to views.

## Views

Build out views based on front end work, which integrate transformed data.
